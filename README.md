# 2D Graphics Engine

This 2D graphics engine is under construction. I am building it throughout the Spring 2023 semester for the course, COMPSCI 345: Graphics Software Architecture, at Duke University. Scaffolding and basic classes have been provided by the professor, Mike Reed, but all of the .cpp and .h files in the parent directory are fully written by me

Note: I am only committing & pushing to this repo when I have full updates. Minor commits & pushes are housed in a separate, private repo.

## Current features

* Drawing with any RGBA color
* Blending with all 12 Porter-Duff blend modes
